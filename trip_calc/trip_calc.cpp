The total number of days spent on the trip
• The time of departure on the first day of the trip, and the time of arrival back home on the last
day of the trip (to the nearest hour)
• The amount of any round-trip airfare

• The amount of any car rentals
• Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used. Calculate the vehicle expense as $0.27 per mile
driven

• Parking fees (The company allows up to $6 per day. Anything in excess of this must be paid by
the employee.)

• Taxi fees, if a taxi was used anytime during the trip (The company allows up to $10 per day, for
each day a taxi was used. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.)

• Hotel expenses (The company allows up to $90 per night for lodging. Anything in excess of this
must be paid by the employee.)
• The amount of each meal eaten. On the first day of the trip, breakfast is allowed as an expense if the time of departure is before 7 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of departure is before 12 noon. Dinner is allowed on the first day if the time of departure is before 6 p.m. On the last day of the trip, breakfast is allowed if the time of arrival is after 8 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of arrival is after 1 p.m. Dinner is allowed on the last day if the time of arrival is after 7 p.m. The program should only ask for the amounts of allowable meals. (The company allows up to $9 for breakfast, $12 for lunch, and $16 for dinner. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the
employee.)

The program should calculate and display the total expenses incurred by the businessperson, the total allowable expenses for the trip, the excess that must be reimbursed by the businessperson, if any, and the amount saved by the businessperson if the expenses were under the total allowed.
